This repository includes a bulk testing project meant to explore the Milkyway@home separation application optimizer's reaction to specific inputs (/testing). This includes a large number of testable star files, parameter files, and a jupyter notebook outlining motivation and progression of the testing project. The goal of this project is to improve intuitive understanding of the optimizers outputs.
